# international_student_website_prototype
A HTML based project. 
This project was completed by December 2018. 

Project Description: 
Kelley School – Indiana University
Tante Sangvrai is the Director of the Office of International Studies (OIS) for the undergraduate program of a large business school (the School) of a major national university (the University) located in the American Midwest. Among its many duties, the OIS is responsible for managing short study abroad programs in which a group of students spend seven to ten days in the company of a lead instructor and several staff members in another country, learning about business practices and socio-cultural customs.
Tante Sangvrai wants to better organize OIS’ operations regarding the management of these study abroad trips, which are currently based on a collection of unrelated spreadsheet and systems. This document transcribes the requirements meeting that Tante had with the two consultants from KGH Partners: Diane Scarlet and Mark Beige.
